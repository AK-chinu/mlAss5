    "Ordinal Encoding:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinal encoding is used when there is an inherent order or rank among the categories of a categorical variable. In ordinal encoding, each category is assigned a unique numerical value based on its order or rank. The numerical values are assigned such that they reflect the ordinal relationship between the categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a categorical variable representing educational attainment with categories \"High School Diploma,\" \"Bachelor's Degree,\" \"Master's Degree,\" and \"Ph.D.\" In ordinal encoding, you might assign numerical values like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "High School Diploma: 1\n",
    "Bachelor's Degree: 2\n",
    "Master's Degree: 3\n",
    "Ph.D.: 4\n",
    "Ordinal encoding assumes that there is a meaningful order or hierarchy among the categories, and it preserves this ordinal relationship in the encoded numerical values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Label Encoding:\n",
    "\n",
    "Label encoding, also known as nominal encoding, is a more general technique used to convert categorical variables into numerical values. In label encoding, each category is assigned a unique numerical value, but there is no assumption of any inherent order or rank among the categories. The numerical values are assigned arbitrarily.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a categorical variable representing car colors with categories \"Red,\" \"Blue,\" \"Green,\" and \"Yellow.\" In label encoding, you might assign numerical values like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "Red: 1\n",
    "Blue: 2\n",
    "Green: 3\n",
    "Yellow: 4\n",
    "Label encoding does not imply any ordinal relationship between the categories, and it treats each category as equally distinct.\n",
    "\n",
    "When to Choose One Over the Other:\n",
    "\n",
    "You might choose ordinal encoding over label encoding when the categorical variable exhibits a clear ordinal relationship among its categories. For example, if you're encoding education levels or customer satisfaction ratings (e.g., \"Low,\" \"Medium,\" \"High\"), ordinal encoding would be appropriate because there is a meaningful order among the categories."
